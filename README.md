# CSC431 - TEAM #13
Intro to Software Engineering

Hello, I am Berk Mankaliye and this is the github repository for my collaborative work
for our CSC431: Introduction to Software Engineering Course at 
University of Miami - Spring 2021.

Scrum Master: Berk Mankaliye

Developer: Demir Demirsoy

In this repository, you may find our Project Proposal, SRS document, SAS document, and
last but not least, our midterm and final presentations.

Our project "Real Time Tracking and Analysis of COVID Hotspots" was established to serve
the public. While many COVID trackers exist on the web, we believe we introduced the concept
of adding a feature that allows the prediction of COVID cases in a given zip code in the future.
Our web application allows the user to input their desired ZIP code, and instantenously acquire 
vital COVID-related information such as number of cases, number of vaccinations and other related
information with an accompaniment of a map. Thereafter, the user can use the time function to 
acquire information from as far as two months prior and additionally gather information generated 
by our AI algorithm that predicts the amount of cases and the danger of travelling to that location.
We believe mainly high-risk individuals and the elderly will benefit from this web application, but
that being said, this app is intended for use by everyone.
